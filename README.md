AI4WRD is an application that performs Data Extraction through Optical Character Recognition from window based applications. Features include:
1. Ability to use both Easy-OCR and Tesseract to perform Optical Character Recognition
2. Ability to crop the video stream to perform OCR on specific sections of the video
3. Ability to recognise specific screens using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform algorithm and associate them with specific sets of crops
4. Ability to save and load crop configurations
5. Output to both CSV and through the MQTT protocol

A more comprehensive introduction to AI4WRD is available at the AI4WRD-OCR Wiki! Portal to [AI4WRD-OCR wiki](https://github.com/msf4-0/AI4WRD-OCR/wiki).

### OCR on Livestream
![liveStream](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72961684/177915077-95867da8-88cc-4d5e-9adf-a314602e72e4.png)
1. In the "OCR Livestream" page, check the done crop checkbox to begin livestream
2. The livestream from your capture device will be visible at the top of the page
3. The livestream of the cropped sections will also appear below the main livestream
4. The OCR result of the crop is displayed below each crop
5. The "Choose Model" dropdown menu allows you to select the model used for ocr
6. The "OCR Confidence Cut-Off" widget allows you to filter out detected text below the defined threshold 
7. The "Save Continuous to csv" button will allow you to continuously save new OCR data into a csv file
8. The "Save Previous to csv" button allows you to save all the previous OCR data to a csv file
9. The csv file will be saved at the specified path
10. The "Publish to mqtt button" allows you to publish detected data to a mqtt broker on the Address, Port and Topic specified. Note: if there are multiple crops they will be published to different topics based on the topic name you specified according to the format <topic specified\><crop number\>. For instance, if there are 2 crops and the topic specified is ai4wrdOutput, the text from crop 1 will be published to ai4wrdOutput1 and the text from crop 2 will be publishe to ai4wrOutput2
11. Note that the zoom tool is still available for you to enlarge crops
